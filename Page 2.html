		<h2>How Does it Promote Security?</h2>
		<p>Cloud computing can have a positive impact on a company’s security, this is for a few reasons. 
		First, due to the nature of cloud computing you can have more control over who has access to the information
		in your system, if established properly and with an emphasis on security then it is possible that the user can only use authorised
		devices to get only the information that they need, this would massively reduce the risk of an unauthorised third party gaining access
		to the information.
		<br>
		<br>
		Another factor that influences security is that the servers that host the data also use firewalls and antiviruses, this means that malware is unlikely to be able to access the companies’ data stored on the server without having phished for any credentials.
		Finally it also secures against losing data, storing data in the cloud means that everyone can get a copy of a file while still maintaining the original, this means that if a file is deleted or edited then the original is still able to be accessed, thus protecting against losses.
