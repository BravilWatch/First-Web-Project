		<h2>What is cloud computing?</h2>
		<p>Cloud computing is a way of accessing internet services on demand anywhere in the world and on any device. 
		It can be very desirable for both companies and individuals due to its benefits such as accessibility, security and cost - effectiveness.</p>
		<p>Cloud computing is a way of storing data in data centres across the world, the data stored can be anything from a picture of a bee to the works of Shakespeare
		to the source code for a game (Cloudflare). In the last few years cloud computing has become a very popular method of saving data, in large part because of its 
		ability to transfer data across devices and the wide array of opportunities that this allows for. One of the best known uses of cloud computing is that it allows people
		from all over the world to share the same document and is therefore indispensable when collaboration is necessary, however cloud computing has many other advantages
		such as the ones I will be focusing on here: Accessibility, the security benefits and the reduction of costs it can bring. (Singh, 2023)</p>
		
		<h2>How Does it Promote Accessibility?</h2>
		<p>Let me first discuss how cloud computing can improve accessibility. There are multiple ways in which this can be achieved. One of them is by facilitating the use of
		technology for people with disabilities. For instance, the Morphic project is a cloud-based auto-personalization program that stores accessibility settings and assistive
		technology preferences in the cloud. This allows for seamless transfer of these settings from one device to another, making it easier for people with special needs to
		have bespoke settings that can be accessed on devices other than their own. This, in turn, enables them to have greater access to technology that was previously unavailable
		to them. (Rubin, 2022)
		<br>
		<br>
		Another method of promoting accessibility is to enable anyone to access their stored information from anywhere in the world, making it easier for people who are not in their
		usual workspace to access the necessary files for completing tasks. This is particularly relevant in the workplace, and the Covid pandemic inadvertently provided an opportunity
		to test the accessibility benefits of cloud computing. In 2020, due to the increase in remote work, companies that had already switched to the cloud found it easier to manage
		the transition of their employees from the office to remote work environments. The flexibility provided by cloud infrastructure and software is the primary reason why the service
		is so effective in promoting accessibility (Thornbury, 2020),
