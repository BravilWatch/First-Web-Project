		<h2>How Does it Reduce Costs?</h2>
		<p>Firstly, storing all this data normally would take a lot of servers which are very expensive to buy run and maintain, paying
		for access to a cloud service gives you the same experience as maintaining your own servers and for a fraction of the price.
		<br>
		<br>
		Another way is that companies can allow their employees to work from home, this means that they may not have to pay too much for an
		office space as well as giving themselves a greater range of employees to choose from, as distance may not be as important a factor. (Hall, 2023)
		<br>
		<br>
		This also gives companies grater control of their IT spending, if at any point they feel as though they need more or less from the service then
		they can simply adjust their service by going online and making the necessary changes. (Techopedia)
